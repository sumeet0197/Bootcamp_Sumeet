#Project Title

Financial Data Pipeline: From Acquisition to Preprocessing.

#Problem Statement

Financial analysts and students often need a clean and reproducible pipeline for acquiring, storing, and preprocessing financial data. However, data sources are fragmented, noisy, and inconsistent across APIs and websites. This project aims to design an end-to-end pipeline that retrieves financial market data (e.g., Apple Inc. stock and S&P 500 constituents), stores it in structured formats, and preprocesses it for further analysis. By solving this, we create a repeatable workflow that matters for both academic learning and professional decision-making.

#Stakeholder & User

Stakeholders: Course instructors and evaluators who assess the correctness of the pipeline.

Users: Students (myself and peers) who need clean, structured data to run statistical or machine-learning models.

Context: Users will run the pipeline in Jupyter/VS Code, generating outputs (CSVs, plots) that can later be extended into modeling and reporting stages.

#Useful Answer & Decision

Type: Descriptive (summary stats, plots), Predictive (future modeling can be added later).

Metrics: Data completeness (no missing values), correctness (expected columns), and reproducibility (pipeline runs end-to-end without errors).

Artifacts: Processed CSV/Parquet files, plots, cleaned dataset, and documentation in notebooks.

#Assumptions & Constraints

Data availability depends on free APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Wikipedia).

Internet access is assumed during data acquisition.

Processing is constrained to local machine capacity.

Compliance: data is publicly available, so no licensing barriers.

Latency: near-real-time not required; daily updates are sufficient.

#Known Unknowns / Risks

APIs may change structure or rate-limit requests.

Web scraping may fail if page layouts change.

Data quality risks: missing values, different time zones, or inconsistent formats.

Risk mitigation: add checks for schema validation, handle missing values systematically.

#Lifecycle Mapping

Goal → Stage → Deliverable

Define problem → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → README + Stakeholder Memo

Set up environment → Tooling Setup (Stage 02) → requirements.txt, .env

Explore fundamentals → Python Fundamentals (Stage 03) → Stats, groupby, plots, CSVs

Collect data → Data Acquisition (Stage 04) → Raw CSVs (API + scrape)

Store data → Data Storage (Stage 05) → CSV & Parquet outputs

Preprocess data → Data Preprocessing (Stage 06) → Cleaned dataset

#Repo Plan

/data/ → raw & processed datasets

/src/ → helper functions (config.py, utils.py)

/notebooks/ → HW01–HW06 notebooks

/docs/ → stakeholder memo, supporting docs

Cadence: update repo after each stage; commit notebooks, outputs, and docs
